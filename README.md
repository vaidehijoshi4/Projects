##### 1. STEALTH (Stereo Analysis from Low texture Thermal Images)
This is the final project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning (11-785). This submodule will direct to the repository of the project.
We experimented with various neural network architectures to estimate Stereo disparity for an Autonomous driving setting based on IR images; out of all the architectures implemented, a modified Pyramidal Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet) along with a super resolution block and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram equalization preprocessing, proved to be the most effective. More details about the implementation and the code can be found on the project repository.
