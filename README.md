# Projects-Courses
## Repository for all projects and work done for courses

1) STEALTH :  Public repository for the Final project of the course Introduction to Deep Learning (11-785). 
              This project is about Stereo Analysis using Low Texture Thermal Images. Many neural network architectures were implemented for the stereo disparity                 estimation in Thermal/IR images. Thermal images are robust to fog, ambient illumination and glare due to incoming car headlights. Hence using IR                     images over RGB images in an autonomous driving setting proves to be helpful in such scenarios. Here we tested many architectures out of which, a                   modified Pyramidal Stereo Matching (PSM) Network with a super resolution block and Contrast Limited Adaptive histogram equalization preprocessing                   proved to be the most effective on the CATS IR image dataset. A brief explanation and necessary code can be found in the repository.
