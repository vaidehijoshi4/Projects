#### The contents of the repository are as follows:


##### 1. STEALTH (Stereo Analysis from Low texture Thermal Images)
This is the final project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning (11-785) at CMU. This submodule will direct to the repository of the project.
We experimented with various neural network architectures to estimate **Stereo disparity** for an **Autonomous driving** setting based on **IR images**; out of all the architectures implemented, a modified **Pyramidal Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet)** along with a **Super resolution block** and **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram equalization** preprocessing, proved to be the most effective. More details about the implementation and the code can be found on the project repository.

##### 2. Million Song Analysis
This is the final project for the course Machine Learning for Large Datasets (10-605) at CMU. This submodule will direct to the repository of the project.
This project aimed at predicting the **'song hotness'** of a given song by training **Linear Regression, Isotonic Regression and Gradient boosted trees ML models** on the **Million Song Dataset of 280 GiB**. **EMR** (Elastic Map Reduce) and **EC2** clusters on **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) were used to undertake computationally expensive training and prediction on this large song dataset.
